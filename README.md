Implementation of symmetric quantile-normalized score voting.

Defined by Connor Frankston on March 16, 2024, with significant contributions from the community at https://www.votingtheory.org/forum/

Symmetric quantile-normalized score voting (SQNV) is a modification to ordinary score voting that preserves desirable properties of score voting while normalizing ballots to reduce the effects of voting tactics such as bullet voting and min-maxing. SQNV is a robust score system that compromises between score and rank voting methods by eliminating the arbitrary nature of cardinal score values assigned to weakly-ranked candidates. Furthermore, symmetric quantile-normalized score voting is naturally Condorcet winner and Condorcet loser compliant, and is therefore a cardinal Condorcet method.

A special thanks is extended to Jack Waugh and Toby Periera for their insightful intellectual engagement and concerns pertaining to the development of this system.
